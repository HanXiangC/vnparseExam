FIXME 11/10/15L: Questions

1a. What is generally meant by "Qualified by thematic role" - use
Theme|Location|Agent
or
+ANIMATE|+CONCRETE etc.?

If some combination of the *latter*, then...
1b.
Thematic roles have both the roles AND qualifications, e.g.
Theme +ANIMATE
Location +CONCRETE

Most VN frame syntax has the thematic roles unqualified in place of NPs, e.g.
Theme V
Theme V {{+spatial}} Location

But some VN frames have roles with same qualifications, e.g. *additionally*
have qualifications, e.g.
(There) V {{+path}} Location [+concrete] Theme <-definite>
(run-51.3.2-2-1)

A: Use qualifiers (selrstrs/synrestrs) instead of the actual thematic roles
(Theme, Agent, Location)...ignore redundancy in individual frames, but include
new selrstrs/synrestrs specific to frames

Alphabetize !!!

Intuition - what are the consequences of changing these verbs? Don't trust
verbnet.

more vnerrors -
shake-22.3 - in syntax, proposition together is last, but ADV-Middle is first
. Doesn't happen for many others

20151118 Q
Q: rely-70.xml: has NP V PP.theme NP S_ING, only has three syntax nodes
NP val agent, Prep val on, NP val theme. So maybe the theme selrestrs
should be attached to PP.theme e.g. PP.theme+animate, but that is very
confusing. Additionally, broader question - do we add synrestrs?
In this case, NP val theme has a synrestr '+np_ing' which actually seems
somewhat semantic. Need to ask Josh.

20151129 Notes
rely-70 NP V PP.theme NP S_ING - just going to get rid of the extra NP. Is this
a glitch, or is there actually a syntactic difference?
So...
JK, don't "GET RID" of the extra NP. Keep it...it just won't have selectional
    restrictions
NP V PP.theme S_ING+(whatever)

engender-27.xml NP V that S has two NPs for S, one is NP val="Theme", one is NP
val="Predicate". I'm just going to "merge" these two into the S and call it
S+concrete, where abstract is the selectional restriction for the Theme NP but
not the Predicate NP (which has a that_comp *syntactic* restriction).

TODO: What to do with NP-PRO-ARB?

20151209 Notes
TODO: What to do with NP-PRO-ARB?

consider-29.9
NP V NP PP.attribute only has two NPs...so...need to differentiate between
other NP V NP PP.attribute
I'm going to leave that PP.attribute semanticsless, because the other ones have
more than 3 NP.

confess-37.10.xml and indicate-78.xml have NP V NP to be NP
tokens only have two NPs. So just attach semantics to the last NP (NP V
        NP+to_be)
NOTE: ^^^ At this point, we may need to begin including synrestrs...

mix-22.1. NP NP V together - needs synrestr, as it's combined into just one NP
i.e. NP V together. Should be NP+plural V together.
